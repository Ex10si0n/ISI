## Introduction

In recent years, growing attention has been paid to electronic business. And among these business activities, online shopping mall is one of major activities. In this case,  we are tend to develop an online shopping mall. And in this document, we will explain basic idea of project scope, schedule and job allocation of our online shopping mall. 

## Project Scope

Our project will include all basic functions and the additional function Z0. In this part, work breakdown structure, milestones and summary tasks are shown.

### Work Breakdown Structure

Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is used to break the whole project into smaller components to make the work more manageable and elastic. Specifically, for this project, we have divided the whole project into for parts -- analysis, design, implementation, and deployment. And several work packages have been grouped into these four parts separately.

Milestones are significant events that normally have no duration. To be more specificm for this project, several milestones are created -- project work plan (Jan 21), Gantt chart and progress check form (Feb 18), accomplishing the implementation of basic requirements (Mar 18), accomplishing the advanced requirements and final report (Apr 8) and presentation and demo (Apr 11).
